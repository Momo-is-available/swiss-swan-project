						<p>
							If the new product’s amount is higher than the

							Usually, a return is put on hold/declined due to the

						</p>
						<p>
							SDA are supposed to perform a set of checks that
							reflect on their device as per the reason for
							return. In case of any check failure, SDA will
							refuse to pick up the product. You can ask the SDA

							Also, ensure you raise the return request with the
