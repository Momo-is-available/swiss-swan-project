					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
						Why do identical products have varying prices? Is this
						practice allowed?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">
						TheSwissSwan operates as an online marketplace that
						allows independent sellers to list and sell their
						products directly to buyers. Pricing is entirely
						determined by the sellers, with no interference from
						TheSwissSwan. This can lead to situations where the same
						product is listed at varying prices by different
						sellers. As a marketplace platform, TheSwissSwan fully
						adheres to all legal requirements related to hosting
						multiple sellers on its platform.

					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
						I noticed a product listed for Rs. 1000, but after
						clicking on it, multiple prices appear, and the size I
						want is priced at Rs. 1600. Why does the price differ on
						the product details page?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">
						TheSwissSwan is an online marketplace where multiple
						sellers may offer the same style at different prices set
						individually by each seller. The price displayed on the
						listing page might not always reflect the lowest price
						for that style. This is because the seller showcased on
						the listing page is selected based on various factors,
						with price being just one of them. However, when you
						navigate to the product display page for a specific
						style, you can view all the prices offered by different
						sellers for that item on the platform.

						How can I identify fraudulent emails or calls that
						attempt to steal sensitive personal and confidential
						information?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">
						<p>
							If you receive an email or a call from someone
							claiming to be from TheSwissSwan and requesting
							sensitive information like debit/credit card PINs,
							net banking, or mobile banking passwords, it is
							crucial that you never provide such personal or
							confidential details. TheSwissSwan or our affiliate
							logistics partners will never ask for this type of
							sensitive information. If you have already disclosed
							such information, please report it immediately to
							the relevant law enforcement authorities.
						</p>
						<ul>
							Here are some common tactics fraudsters use to
							deceive consumers:
							<li>
								"Congratulations! You've been nominated as a
								'Top TheSwissSwan customer' and are eligible for
								a luxury gift. Please share your proof of
								address and debit/credit card details to claim
								your prize."
							</li>
							<li>
								"Hi, I'm calling from TheSwissSwan. We're
								pleased to inform you that you've won an
								exclusive lucky draw coupon worth Rs. 5000 on
								your recent purchase. Kindly share your
								credit/debit card number so we can transfer the

						How can I verify if an appointment letter is legitimate?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">
						<ol>
							Be cautious of fraudulent individuals or agencies
							that target job seekers by offering career
							opportunities at TheSwissSwan in exchange for fees
							such as:
							<li>Recruitment fees</li>
							<li>Processing fee</li>
							<li>Security Deposit</li>
							<li>Charges for software or equipment</li>
							<li>Onboarding fees, etc.</li>

						<p>
							TheSwissSwan's Cash on Delivery (COD) option allows
							you to pay the order value at the time of delivery
							for all orders between Rs. 299 and Rs. 49,999. To
							use the COD mode of payment, select the 'Cash On

						<p>
							The COD limit may vary depending on the customer's
							order rejection percentage associated with their
							registered email ID. The "Order Rejection
							Percentage" refers to undelivered orders returned
							from the provided address even after three
							successful delivery attempts. If the COD limit is
							breached, the order will be canceled, and you will
							need to place a new order using one of the
							pre-payment options.
						</p>

							<li>Rs. 0</li>

											<li>
												If the total discount percentage
												is more than 19% of MRP,

										price, after applying discounts. The
										discounts include those resulting from
										special offers such as Buy 1 Get 1 and
										similar offers.
									</li>
									<li>
										For a product, if the order is placed on
										or after 15th November 2019, the

					<li class="answer">
						<p>
							If you haven't received your reward after sharing
							your referral link with a friend, here are some
							possible reasons:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>First-Time Sign-up Requirement:</strong>
								Your friend must sign up as a first-time user on
								the platform. If they have previously made a
								transaction on TheSwissSwan, the referral won't
								be eligible for rewards.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Completion of Transaction:</strong> Your
								friend needs to complete a purchase from the
								SwissSwan selection using your referral link.
								The reward is granted only after the successful
								transaction. Encourage your friend to use the
								coupon they received for the purchase.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>SwissSwan Selection Purchase:</strong>
								If your friend made a purchase but it was not
								from the SwissSwan selection, you will not
								receive a reward.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Return Period:</strong> Rewards are
								issued only after the return period for your
								friend's purchase has ended. If the return
								period is still active, you may need to wait a
								little longer.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>No Returns:</strong> If your friend
								returns the items they purchased, the referral
								reward will not be granted.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Offer Period:</strong> Ensure that the
								referral was made during the Offer Period (1st
								Aug - 31st Dec 2024). If the offer is outside
								this period, the referral will not count.
							</li>

					</li>

				<ul>
					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
						How can I verify that my friend was indeed a first-time
						user on TheSwissSwan?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">

							if they are not a first-time user on TheSwissSwan
							platform.

				<ul>
					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">

							Your friend must either click on the link you shared
							through your referral or enter your referral code on
							the sign-up page.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">

				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">

						My friend entered my referral code, but did not get any
						coupon. Why?
					</li>
					<li class="answer">
						<p>

								may no longer be eligible to refer friends due
								to multiple possible reasons.
